# Cost Clock

A customizable JavaScript clock that can help you show the true cost of a meeting. 

Deployed with New Jersey public employee salary data at [CostClock.com](https://costclock.com).

## Data

Where other JavaScript meeting clocks provide you a rough estimate and one cost-based multiplier, Cost Clock allows you to enter salary/compensation data for individual members, allowing you to better reflect the cost of a meeting. 



## Disclaimer

If you are using this clock, you are likely unhappy with the inefficiency of the meeting and its participants. Keep in mind that unlike gears in a machine, your fellow meeting attendees have minds and feelings. Don't use this clock to shame individuals or discourage participation.
